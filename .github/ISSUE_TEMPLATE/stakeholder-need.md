# High level description

Describe the need you have either with use cases or examples.

# Requirements

What does the system need to do?

## Test plans

How do we test that these requirements are fulfilled correctly? What are some edge cases we should be aware of when developing the test code?

# Design

Document, discuss, and optionally upload design diagram into this section.

<!--
## Algorithm demonstration

If this issue requires a change in an algorithm, it should be described here. This algorithm should be described thoroughly enough to be used as documentation. This section may also simply refer to an algorithm in the literature or in another piece of software that has been validated. The quality of that reference will be determined case by case.

## API definition

Define how the Nyx APIs will be affect by this: what are new functions available, do any previous function change their definition, why call these functions by that name, etc.

Try to add an ASCII diagram of how this should work. If you need to draw a diagram, you can use [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
