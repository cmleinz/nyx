# Orbit propagation

Propagating an orbit is the core of any astrodynamics analysis. In this example, you'll learn how to propagate an orbit state using basic two body dynamics or using a high fidelity propagator with the point masses of the Moon and Sun, solar radiation pressure, and a 21x21 gravity field.

Then, you'll learn how to build some data products as dataframes.
