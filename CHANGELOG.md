# Change Log

## 2.0.0

**Warning:** this should be considered a rewrite of Nyx.

### Most important breaking changes

1. Cosm has been replaced by ANISE, the SPICE rewrite in Rust.

### License change

Nyx is now under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 instead of the AGPL v3.

- Updated Nyx's license from GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL v3) to Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0). This change enhances flexibility for users in how they interact with, modify, and distribute Nyx, making it more accessible for a wider range of applications. Key aspects of this licensing shift include:
  - **Source Code Sharing**: The MPL 2.0 requires sharing modifications of changed files but does not mandate sharing if the software is used over a network, offering a more favorable environment for web applications.  
  - **License Compatibility**: The MPL 2.0 improves compatibility with other open-source licenses, facilitating easier integration with various projects and software stacks.
  - **Distribution Flexibility**: While MPL 2.0 maintains the open-source ethos by requiring modifications to be shared under the same license, it allows for broader distribution practices, accommodating diverse licensing needs of derivative works.
  
This licensing update aims to encourage broader participation in Nyx's development and use, especially in commercial contexts, by providing a balance between openness and practical utility.
