# Nyx: Comprehensive Spaceflight Dynamics

[**Empowering flight dynamics engineers with open-source software**](https://nyxspace.com/)

Nyx is revolutionizing the field of flight dynamics engineering as a powerful, open-source tool for mission design and orbit determination. From trajectory optimization to orbit estimation, Nyx is built for speed, automation, and scalability. It dramatically reduces simulation time compared to commercial products, and integrates seamlessly into automated workflows across various platforms.

**Nyx has proven mission-critical reliability, already contributing to the success of three lunar missions.**
